* Perform a graceful reset of the Ethernet MAC. Resets the DMA channels, the

* Steps to reset
* - Stops transmit and receive channels
* - Stops DMA
* - Configure transmit and receive buffer size to default
* - Clear transmit and receive status register and counters
* - Clear all interrupt sources
* - Clear phy (if there is any previously detected) address
* - Clear MAC addresses (1-4) as well as Type IDs and hash value
*
* All options are placed in their default state. Any frames in the

* this is that after a reset and following a restart of the device, frames
* were in the list before the reset may be transmitted or received.
*
* The upper layer software is responsible for re-configuring (if necessary)
* and restarting the MAC after the reset. Note also that driver statistics
* are not cleared on reset. It is up to the upper layer software to clear the
* statistics if needed.
*
* When a reset is required, the driver notifies the upper layer software of
* this need through the ErrorHandler callback and specific status codes.
* The upper layer software is responsible for calling this Reset function
* and then re-configuring the device.
